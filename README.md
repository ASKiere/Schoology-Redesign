## Why I Did This

I just hated my original schoology design, and while it was redesigned some time this year, I still wasn't a fan
So I made this!

## How Do I Use It?

I would reccomend the extension Magic CSS.
https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor
It is on all common extension stores.
Paste the code from this repo to your Magic CSS and pin it.
